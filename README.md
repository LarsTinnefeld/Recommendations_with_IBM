## Inroduction <a name="business_understanding"></a>
This project is part of Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree program and was provided by IBM Watson Studio. IBM Watson Studio is managing a platform which provides articles to their user community. Selected articles are presented to users on the landing page's dashboard. Users can react to the content by communicating via email. These interactions are the only way a user's interest could be measured. The provided datasets contain the anonymized email adresses along with the article-ID the message was dealing with and a lookup table in which the articles are listed with their ID and content.

## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>
IBM is asking in this project to investigate ways to develop an algorithm which can recommend articles to users on the dashboard. The selection of these articles should be based on the recommendation algorithm. The objectives can be broken down to sub-tasks in the following way:

- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Rank-Based Recommendations
- User-Based Collaborative Filtering
- Content-Based Recommendations
- Matrix Factorization
